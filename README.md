# leaderboard

In this repo, I have created a leaderboard in Java. The players and their scores are created in a class called Players and the leaderboard is done utlizing an ArrayList. 

In order to run the program, open this repo in an IDE and in the folder called "code" go to the file main.java. In this file you will see the function that creates the players as well as returns the top N players. Please enter your desired number in the line of code that runs the function that returns the top N players. This is highlighted with a comment. You can also create more players by following the below code:

Player pn = new Player("n", 600,200);


players.add(pn);
